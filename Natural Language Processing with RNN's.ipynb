    "# Natural Language Processing \n",
    "NLP is a discipline in computing that deals with the communication between human languages and computer languages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recurrent Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks that are more capable of processing sequential data such as text or characters are called **recurrent neural network** (RNN for short). \n",
    "\n",
    "Reccurent neural network can to do the following:\n",
    "- Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "- Character Generation \n",
    "\n",
    "RNN's are complex and come in many different forms so in this tutorial we wil focus on how they work and the kind of problems they are best suited for.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sequence Data\n",
    "In this tutorial we will look at sequences of text and learn how we can encode them in a meaningful way. Unlike images, sequence data such as long chains of text, weather patterns, videos and really anything where the notion of a step or time is relevant needs to be processed and handled in a special way. \n",
    "\n",
    "But what do I mean by sequences and why is text data a sequence? Well that's a good question. Since textual data contains many words that follow in a very specific and meaningful order, we need to be able to keep track of each word and when it occurs in the data. Simply encoding say an entire paragraph of text into one data point wouldn't give us a very meaningful picture of the data and would be very difficult to do anything with. This is why we treat text as a sequence and process one word at a time. We will keep track of where each of these words appear and use that information to try to understand the meaning of peices of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encoding Text\n",
    "As we know machine learning models and neural networks don't take raw text data as an input. This means we must somehow encode our textual data to numeric values that our models can understand. There are many different ways of doing this and we will look at a few examples below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into the different encoding/preprocessing methods let's understand the information we can get from textual data by looking at the following two movie reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "```I thought the movie was going to be bad, but it was actually amazing!```\n",
    "\n",
    "```I thought the movie was going to be amazing, but it was actually bad!```\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these two setences are very similar we know that they have very different meanings. This is because of the **ordering** of words, a very important property of textual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now keep that in mind while we consider some different ways of encoding our textual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bag of Words\n",
    "The first and simplest way to encode our data is to use something called **bag of words**. This is a pretty easy technique where each word in a sentence is encoded with an integer and thrown into a collection that does not maintain the order of the words but does keep track of the frequency. Have a look at the python function below that encodes a string of text into bag of words. "

    "Much better, now we are keeping track of the order of words and we can tell where each occurs. But this still has a few issues with it. Ideally when we encode words, we would like similar words to have similar labels and different words to have very different labels. For example, the words happy and joyful should probably have very similar labels so we can determine that they are similar. While words like horrible and amazing should probably have very different labels. The method we looked at above won't be able to do something like this for us. This could mean that the model will have a very difficult time determing if two words are similar or not which could result in some pretty drastic performace impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Word Embeddings\n",
    "Luckily there is a third method that is far superior, **word embeddings**. This method keeps the order of words intact as well as encodes similar words with very similar labels. It attempts to not only encode the frequency and order of words but the meaning of those words in the sentence. It encodes each word as a dense vector that represents its context in the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the previous techniques word embeddings are learned by looking at many different training examples. You can add what's called an embedding layer to the beggining of your model and while your model trains your embedding layer will learn the correct embeddings for words. You can also use pretrained embedding layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN's)\n",
    "Now that we've learned a little bit about how we can encode text it's time to dive into recurrent neural networks. Up until this point we have been using something called **feed-forward** neural networks. This simply means that all our data is fed forwards (all at once) from left to right through the network. This was fine for the problems we considered before but won't work very well for processing text. After all, even we (humans) don't process text all at once. We read word by word from left to right and keep track of the current meaning of the sentence so we can understand the meaning of the next word. Well this is exaclty what a recurrent neural network is designed to do. When we say recurrent neural network all we really mean is a network that contains a loop. A RNN will process one word at a time while maintaining an internal memory of what it's already seen. This will allow it to treat words differently based on their order in a sentence and to slowly build an understanding of the entire input, one word at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why we are treating our text data as a sequence! So that we can pass one word at a time to the RNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look at what a recurrent layer might look like.\n",

    "\n",
    "What this diagram is trying to illustrate is that a recurrent layer processes words or input one at a time in a combination with the output from the previous iteration. So, as we progress further in the input sequence, we build a more complex understanding of the text as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we've just looked at is called a **simple RNN layer**. It can be effective at processing shorter sequences of text for simple problems but has many downfalls associated with it. One of them being the fact that as text sequences get longer it gets increasingly difficult for the network to understand the text properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## LSTM\n",
    "The layer we dicussed in depth above was called a *simpleRNN*. However, there does exist some other recurrent layers (layers that contain a loop) that work much better than a simple RNN layer. The one we will talk about here is called LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). This layer works very similarily to the simpleRNN layer but adds a way to access inputs from any timestep in the past. Whereas in our simple RNN layer input from previous timestamps gradually disappeared as we got further through the input. With a LSTM we have a long-term memory data structure storing all the previously seen inputs as well as when we saw them. This allows for us to access any previous value we want at any point in time. This adds to the complexity of our network and allows it to discover more useful relationships between inputs and when they appear. \n",

    "For the purpose of this course we will refrain from going any further into the math or details behind how these layers work.\n",
